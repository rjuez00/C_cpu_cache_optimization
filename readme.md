Optimization of C code by testing how to correctly access a matrix so that it uses the processor cache correctly. If you access it in the correct order it can speed up greatly as we show in the comparisons under matrix_cache_test/memoria.pdf. Then we optimize an edge detection code, the code was given with a slow performance and loop unrolling, correct matrix traversal, and other optimizations are applied to try to optimize the code to allow real time execution.
